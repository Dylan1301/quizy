## Basic working with GitHub everyday
Before starting a new task, follow these steps:

1. Pull the latest code from the main branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your task:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your_name/task_name
   ```

3. Make changes and commit them:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "frontend: Your change notes"
   ```

4. Push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin your_name/task_name
   ```

5. Create a pull request:
   - Look at the terminal, you can find a link like "https://github.com/swinburne-projects/quizy/pull/new/YOUR_BRANCH_NAME", just click on that
   
   Or

   - Go to the [GitHub PR page](https://github.com/swinburne-projects/quizy/pulls)
   - Click on 'New pull request'
   - Choose your branch from the dropdown menu

   Continue

   - Click `Reviewers` on the right aside, choose `thanhhoa214` for review
   - Add snapshot for UI about the change, and detail description about the change
   - Click on 'Create pull request'

6. Let the team know about your PR, paste it to the group chat for review & merge

Remember to replace `your-branch-name` and `Your commit message` with your actual branch name and commit message.

7. Running and testing seed data
   - Get to Docker Backend container
   - Get to Exec tab and run `python seed.py`. You only need to run this once.
   - The teacher test credentials is:
      - Username: `admin@email.com`
      - Password: `admin123`
   - Please check seed_data.json file in the backend for more info.
   - Incase issues: DROP CASCADE all tables and rerun the docker. (This will wipe out all data)
    ```sql
   DROP TABLE answer CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE question CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE questionresponse CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE quiz CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE room CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE student CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE teacher CASCADE;
   ```
